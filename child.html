        <p>"Submitted by Ravjibhai Parbatbhai Pankhaniya<br>
          Atlanta, Georgia, USA.</p>
        <p> It gives me great pleasure in writing a brief history of the
          Pankhaniya Family, especially for this historic event, the launch of a
          web site for Shree Sorathia Prajapati Gnati Mandal, Atlanta Georgia.
          This website is the first ever of its kind for the SSPGM members
          worldwide. I am very excited to be a resident of Atlanta USA, where
          this website is being launched. I cannot express my excitement by a
          mere few words. </p>
        <p> I have been given this opportunity and I consider this a great
          priveledge to write a few words about the Pankhaniya family. A lot of
          the information you will read below was painstakingly collected and
          compiled by Kaviraj Manharbhai Buddhiisagarbhai Barot, Ranavav and
          published by the executive committee members of the Pankhaniya Samelan
          (UK 2000). </p>
        <p> Today, the Pankhaniya family is the largest within the Shree
          Sorathia Prajapati Gnati. Pankhaniya family originated from Chudasama,
          Rajput Kshatriya family. History reveals that Krishna Bhagwan's 79th
          Generation of Chandravanshi Chudasama Rajput Kshatriyas gave birth to
          King Denendra. He had a son named Gajpat, who ruled his kingdom from
          Junagadh. One of the Chudasama Rajput families led by Savji Dada
          settled in 'Pankhan', a place near Keshod, hence we are known as
          Pankhaniya. He also married a girl from Prajapati Kumbhar family. Along
          with the Pankhaniya family, there was a Vadher family who lived in
          Pankhan.The Pankhaniya and the Vadher families lived happily together,
          and accepted each other as brothers. The two families did not
          intermarry with each other while keeping their blood lines clean, they
          called themselves "Sakh Brothers" and do so at this present day. </p>
        <p> Pankhaniya worshipped their family deity Adhya Shakti Harshidhhi
          Mataji. We also believe in Brahmani, Naag Bapa and Vachhara Dada. </p>
        <p> From our ancestor Savji Dada, the genertions continued
          chronologically as Virji, Vikramji, Khasia, Saria, Deva, Hira, Mala,
          Mandan, Munja, Samat, Sarman. After the Mandan family we branched out
          and settled in different places. Mandan Bapa died a valiant warrior in
          Pankhan. His rock memorial as 'Surapura' was erected. There is also a
          well known as Pankhan Vav. From Pankhan, some of us went and settled in
          Pata (ghed), some in Palakhada, some in Bhardwada. Rock memorials of
          our defenders and valiant warrior are evident in Pankhan, Pata, Mader,
          Kadachha and Shingada. </p>
        <p> At present, some Pankhaniya families worship their Kurdevi, Shree
          Harshidhhi Mata and pay their homage at temples in Miyani near Dwarka
          and at Ujjain, in Rajasthan. Others worship Lord Krishna and pay homage
          to Maha Prabhuji Bethak at Gaga Gurgat near Dwarka and Shree Nathji
          temple at Naathadwara in Rajasthan. </p>
        <p> In spite of these variations, we are all united and live
          harmoniously as one 'Pankhaniya' Family."</p></div></td>
